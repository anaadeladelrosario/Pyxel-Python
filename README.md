# Project Setup

## Introduction

This project helps you set up a Python project with a virtual environment.

## Installation

To set up the project:

1. Install Python and add it to your system's PATH.
2. Verify Python installation by running `python --version`.
3. Verify Pip installation by running `pip --version`.
4. Create a project folder.
5. Inside the project folder, create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`.
6. Activate the virtual environment by running `.\venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux).
7. Install Pyxel by running `pip install pyxel`.
8. Inside the project folder, create a file called `main.py`.
9. Run your code:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Deactivation
